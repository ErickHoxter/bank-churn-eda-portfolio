# Bank Customer Churn Analysis (EDA & Insights)

This project explores a dataset of 10,000 retail banking customers to understand **why customers churn** and identify the **key drivers behind customer attrition**.  
It demonstrates strong skills in **exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning interpretation** using Python.

---

## Project Overview

Customer churn—when customers leave a bank—is a major business problem.  
This exploratory analysis answers three essential questions:

### ** What is the overall churn rate?**  
### ** Which customer segments are most likely to churn?**  
### ** Which features contribute most to churn?**

This notebook includes clean, presentation-ready visualizations, including:

- Churn distribution bar chart  
- Churn rate by geography  
- Churn rate by gender  
- Churn rate by age group  
- Numeric-feature boxplots  
- Correlation matrix  
- Random Forest feature importance chart  

Each visualization includes annotations, consistent styling, and business-focused explanation.

## Key Findings

- **Overall churn rate:** ~20%  
- **Older customers churn at significantly higher rates**  
- **German customers show the highest churn**  
- **Customers with only 1 product churn far more often**  
- **Higher balances correlate with higher churn**  
- **Inactive customers churn at much higher rates**

A full “Churn Drivers” narrative is available inside the notebook.

## Business Value

This analysis helps banks:

- Identify the customer groups most at risk of churn  
- Prioritize customer retention efforts  
- Improve engagement strategies  
- Understand behavioral drivers of churn  
- Reduce revenue loss by predicting attrition early

## Why This Project Stands Out

This repository demonstrates:

- Professional EDA workflow  
- Clear, modern data visualizations  
- Thoughtful business insights  
- Machine-learning interpretability  
- Strong communication of findings  
- End-to-end analysis
